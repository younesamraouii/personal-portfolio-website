					<h6 style="font-size: large;"> March 2021 – June 2021</h6>
					<P style="font-size: larger;">As an intern on the Data Science team, I was responsible for implementing predictive analytics into the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of Yassir, the leading ride-hailing company in Algeria. My project aimed to help the company to overcome the problem of cannibalisation through discount pricing which is a common problem in the industry of ride-hailing, caused by the abundance of promotional codes. In my project, I started by using SQL queries in Google Cloud BigQuery to extract data on millions of ride requests from the company’s datasets. I used K-Means clustering techniques to divide the database into segments of riders. Then, I predicted the next day of purchase of customers from each resulting segment. The final step was to create a model that restrained the problem of cannibalization by selecting the right subset of customers to offer promotional codes based on their likelihood of making a trip. The project was successful because it did not only result in an ML model with high accuracy but also different customers’ profiles that help marketers in selecting the right marketing campaigns, which proved to increase the company’s revenue and maximise the user experience.</P>

					<h6 style="font-size: large;"> November 2020 – December 2020</h6>
					<p style="font-size: larger;">At a local agency of Bank ABC, I worked on developing a customer-centric banking model to build a lasting relationship with customers, which is becoming more unstable amid ferocious competition from rival traditional and internet-only banks. The customer-centricity approach requires re-evaluation and a better understanding of customers. Therefore, I conducted survey research on customer experience in banking, and I administered a questionnaire in face-to-face delivery mode. After collecting a massive quantity of data, I processed and analysed it using IBM SPSS Statistics. This experience showed me the endless possibilities of analytics as it successfully helped reduce gaps between customer expectations and existing banking products and services.</p>

					<h4 style="color:#34495E;">About Me</h4>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: larger;">Back in high school, I didn't have a clear vision for my life and having to choose a major after graduation put me in a bit of a dilemma😢. With no major in mind, I enrolled in core courses in an undergraduate economics curriculum in the belief that it will quickly land me a job😎. Introductory statistics was one of the greatest courses I took, it had an impact on me without even realizing it because I ended up buying a vintage statistics textbook📖 from a local flea market and I went through that book thoroughly. One year later, I switched to statistics simply because I had a grasp of STEM topics. Luckily, I took pleasure in studying it and I had one great teacher to look up to, which later initiated my interest in data science.</p>
					<p style="font-size: larger;">When the outbreak of COVID-19 became a global pandemic😷, students stayed at home, and universities adopted digital remote learning policies (huge disappointment😞). However, every cloud has a silver lining because it finally led me to take drastic steps to learn more about the field of data science. I was intrigued by the combination of two disciplines that I have always wished I could major in both; computer science and statistics.</p>
					<p style="font-size: larger;">I developed my technical experience through internships and projects in different industries like banking, energy, and ride-hailing. I want to pursue my career in data science by undertaking more projects and constantly learning and journeying my way through data, a journey full of discovery, insights, and innovation.</p>
					<p style="font-size: larger;">Outside of academics and career pursuits, you'll probably find me running🏃 or playing football on the pitch🥅 under the night sky, aglow with bright city lights🌃.</p>

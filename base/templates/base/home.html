					<p>I recently graduated with a master's degree in applied statistics from the National Higher School of Statistics and Applied Economics of Kolea, Algeria.</p>
					<p>After receiving my degree, I was selected into SAP Young Professionals Program, an intensive 3 months-long training program that aims to provide youths with the right set of tools to help companies succeed in their digital transformation. This program offers training courses delivered by SAP expert trainers from around the world as well as diverse soft-skills workshops delivered by high performing training and development organisations from the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
					<p>I have an interest in data science and I have always been intrigued by the underlying power of data and how the intersection of statistical methods and business knowledge can innovate wonders.</p>

					<h4>About Me</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Back in high school, I didn't have a clear vision for my life and having to choose a major after graduation put me in a bit of a dilemma😢. With no major in mind, I enrolled in core courses in an undergraduate economics curriculum in the belief that it will quickly land me a job😎. Introductory statistics was one of the greatest courses I took, it had an impact on me without even realizing it because I ended up buying a vintage statistics textbook from a local flea market and I went through that book thoroughly. One year later, I switched to statistics simply because I had a grasp of STEM topics. Luckily, I took pleasure in studying it and I had one great teacher to look up to, which later initiated my interest in data science.</p>
					<p>When the outbreak of COVID-19 became a global pandemic😷, students were sent home and universities adopted digital remote learning policies (huge disappointment😞). However, every cloud has a silver lining because it finally led me to take drastic steps to learn more about the field of data science. I was intrigued by the combination of two disciplines that I have always wished I could major in both; computer science and statistics.</p>
					<p>I developed my technical experience throughout internships and projects in different industries including banking, energy, and ride-hailing. I want to pursue my career in data science to undertake more projects and constantly learn and journey my way through data, a journey full of discovery, insights, and innovation.</p>
					<p>Outside of academics and career pursuits, you'll probably find me running🏃 or playing soccer on the field🥅 with my friends under the night sky, aglow with bright city lights🌃.</p>
